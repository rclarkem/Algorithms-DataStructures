# Algorithms-Data Structures Repository


## Overview

This is my repo for housing all of my practice for learning algorithms and data structures.  

This repo will also serve as a notebook and resource hub for various javascript topics such as Big-O Notation and different sorting algorithms. I will try to post links to sites and resources according to each topic that I find helpful. 

## Structure

### js_practice:
I have organized this repo into folders to give it some structure. The ***js_practice folder*** holds many of the algorithm problems I have tried to complete myself from a variety of resources such as: 
 - codewars
 - hackerrank
 - some udemy courses.

Many of the prompts are written into the code, if you want to try the problems yourself without looking at my solutions to some of them. 

### algo_course:
The ***algo_Course*** folder is my notebook of lecture notes as I go through a udemy course I purchased.

**I will not be including any resources directly from the course as I do not own the material, but have linked the course itself if you wish to purchase it.**
