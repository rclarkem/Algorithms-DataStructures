# Problem Solving Patterns

## Improve Your Understanding of Algorithms

Some examples of common algorithm patterns:

1. Frequency Counter
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Windows
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Backtracking
   ....

Think of these as blueprints to starting your problems.

## Frequency Counter

Uses an object or set to collect values/frequency of value.

_Key of when to use_: **When the problem asks how many times something occurs or the most/least occuring element**

- Great for avoiding nested loops or O(n<sup>2</sup>) operations.

- Its usually O(n).
