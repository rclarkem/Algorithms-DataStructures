## Problem Solving Patterns

### Understand The Problem

1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?

2. What are the inputs and what are the outputs?

   - what are the outputs that should come from the solution?

3. Do you have enough information to solve the problem before implementing your solution?

4. How should I label important pieces of information?

### Concrete Examples

1. Start with simple inputs
2. Try complex inputs
3. Empty inputs - `""`
4. Invalid inputs - `null`, `undefined`, etc.

### Break Down Problem

1. Write down the in clear steps, what you need to solve and get.
   - This allows for a better understanding of inputs and outputs and any caveats the question may be telling you.
2. For your function(s), start by writing down what you will need to do in clear steps.

### Problem Solving/Simplify

1. If you know that the problem you are beginning to solve is difficult or has a part you will get stuck on, ignore that difficulty to at least get started on the problem.
2. write simplified solution.
3. Then try to work back in the difficulty into your function.

### Look Back and Refactor

1. Is there a better way to do this?

   - can you do this in a different way?
   - can you improve the performance i.e Big O
   - style guide
