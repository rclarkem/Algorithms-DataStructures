## Problem Solving Patterns

### Understand The Problem

1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?

2. What are the inputs and what are the outputs?

   - what are the outputs that should come from the solution?

3. Do you have enough information to solve the problem before implementing your solution?

4. How should I label important pieces of information?

### Concrete Examples

1. Start with simple inputs
2. Try complex inputs
3. Empty inputs - `""`
4. Invalid inputs - `null`, `undefined`, etc.

### Break Down Problem
